# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simulation of the renown game called "Tic-Tac-Toe." All of this code is written using the programming language JAVA (ECLIPSE). 

Description:

The game consists of 2 Players: (Player 1 being displayed as 'X' and Player 2 being displayed as 'O')

The objective of this game is the same as any other form of Tic-Tac-Toe, which is to be the first player to "[succeed] in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row [to win] the game."

The game will continue until there is a winner declared or a draw occurs (i.e. a situation where no available spots are left to place a symbol and there is not a winner announced)

Description of the way it's programmed:

Each player manually selects where to place their corresponding symbol on the board. If it's already taken, the player is allowed to go again until they've placed their mark in a spot that's considered "legal" under the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.
